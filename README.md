jul-ext
=======
An extension to the classes and interfaces of the JavaTM 2 platform's core logging facilities.

I am experimenting with [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/ "HipChat") 
and [logentries](https://www.logentries.com "logentries").

If we are able to use this code into production I might invest more time 
in this project.
